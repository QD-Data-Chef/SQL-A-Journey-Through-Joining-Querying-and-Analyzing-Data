# SQL-A-Journey-Through-Joining-Querying-and-Analyzing-Data
I embarked on this exciting project to put my skills with SQL query syntax to the test and expand my expertise. The project involved the creation of three different tables. Through joining and querying these tables, I was able to find answers to thought-provoking questions based on a data set. It all started when I stumbled upon an image on Twitter. The author started a challenge me to create the table and answer questions based on the image. Initially, I thought it would be a breeze, but little did I know, it would be more challenging than expected! Creating the table was a piece of cake, but the real adventure began when I had to utilize window functions and subqueries. For those familiar with SQL, you know that these can be quite tricky!
